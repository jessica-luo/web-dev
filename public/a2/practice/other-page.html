I'm not naturally great with names. But I try really hard at it and I'm pretty relentless at asking for them when I don't know it. I suppose it's possible you were there and vocal and active and it's just blanked out of my memory. That's unfalsifiable. But I think 13 out of 15 in terms of class participation when I wouldn't recognize you on the back of a milk carton is fairly generous.
